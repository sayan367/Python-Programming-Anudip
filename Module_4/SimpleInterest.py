principal = 200 # principal amount
time = 5 # years for which principal amount is invested
rate = 5 # rate of interest

# Simple Interest formula: SI = (P * R * T) / 100
simple_interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100 # caluclating simple interest
print(f"Simple Interest: Rs. {simple_interest}") # printing the result.
